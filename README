# Plugin Actions Safety Feature

**Plugin Actions Safety Feature** is a WordPress plugin designed to enhance the safety and accountability of plugin management on live WordPress sites. It introduces a warning modal for activating or deactivating plugins and logs these actions in a database, with the ability to export the log to CSV. This is particularly useful for managing "mission-critical" plugins on a live site.

## Features

- **Warning Modal**: Displays a warning modal when activating or deactivating a plugin, to prevent accidental changes.
- **Action Logging**: Logs every activation or deactivation of plugins in a database table.
- **CSV Export**: Provides the ability to export the plugin action log to a CSV file.
- **Critical Plugin Protection**: Disables the deactivation link for specified "mission-critical" plugins.

## Installation

1. **Upload Plugin**: Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. **Activate Plugin**: Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. **Configure Critical Plugins**: Modify the `$critical_plugins` array in the `da_disable_deactivation` function to include your mission-critical plugins.
4. **(Optional) Configure Modal Delay**: Modify the `countdown` variable in the `da_plugin_actions_speedbump` function to change the delay before the modal appears. Default setting is 10 seconds.

## Usage

- The plugin works automatically upon activation. The deactivation links for critical plugins will be disabled.
- When attempting to activate or deactivate any plugin, a confirmation modal will appear.
- The plugin actions log can be viewed under the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress dashboard.
- Use the 'Export to CSV' button on the Plugin Action Log page to export the log.
